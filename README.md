# Hi, I'm Shuwei Lin 👋

## Senior Backend Software Engineer

I’m a backend-focused software engineer with extensive experience designing, building, and operating scalable, event-driven systems in production environments. My work centers on API design, distributed systems, cloud-native architectures, and developer productivity, with  strong emphasis on reliability, observability, and maintainability.

I’ve worked across fintech, health insurance, media AI platforms, enterprise data systems, and e-commerce, building services that support high-throughput workloads, real-time event processing, and complex third-party integrations. I enjoy translating ambiguous business requirements into  lear technical architectures and mentoring through code, documentation, and system design.

I hold an **MS in Mechanical Engineering** from **Cal Poly Pomona** and a **BS in Mathematics (Specialization in Computing)** from **UCLA**, which strongly influences my analytical and systems-oriented approach to engineering.

I’m currently exploring how **AI can augment backend engineering workflows**, including incident analysis, system documentation, architecture reasoning, and developer tooling.

## What I’m Working On

- Building scalable backend services using **TypeScript, NestJS, and AWS**
- Designing **event-driven systems** with Kafka and SQS
- Improving **observability, error handling, and operational resilience**
- Exploring **AI-assisted tooling** for:
  - Incident analysis
  - Architecture documentation (ADR generation)
  - Developer productivity and code reasoning

---

## What I Care About

- Clean APIs and well-defined contracts
- Systems that fail predictably and recover gracefully
- Code that is easy to understand and maintain long-term
- Using AI as a **force multiplier**, not a replacement for engineering judgment

---

## Fun Facts

- Strong preference for backend and infrastructure work
- Enjoy turning complex systems into simple mental models
- Believe good documentation is a feature, not a luxury
